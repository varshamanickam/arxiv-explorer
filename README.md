# ArXiv Tree-Based Explorer

## Project Overview
This project moves beyond clean, classroom-style datasets and applies tree-based data structures to real-world, noisy data. Using the ArXiv research paper dataset, we build a hierarchical indexing system that enables efficient navigation and search of research papers by category and metadata.

The system organizes papers into a tree structure based on:
- Primary category (e.g., cs, math, physics)
- Subcategory (e.g., cs.CL, math.CO)
- Metadata (title, authors, abstract, DOI)

This allows users to perform queries such as:
> "Find all papers in Computer Science → NLP → Transformers"

---

## Core Idea
We implement an **N-ary tree (hierarchical tree)** where:
- The root represents the entire dataset  
- First-level nodes represent **top-level categories**  
- Second-level nodes represent **subtopics**  
- Each node stores associated research papers  

Since papers can belong to multiple categories, they may appear in multiple branches of the tree.

---

## Features
- Handles real-world noisy data (missing values, formatting issues)
- Preprocessing pipeline for large-scale JSON dataset
- Tree-based indexing for efficient lookup
- Multi-category insertion (one paper appears in multiple paths)
- Keyword-based search (title + abstract)
- Scalable design (tested on 10,000+ records, extendable to full dataset)

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset contains noisy real-world data including:
- Missing values  
- Inconsistent formatting  
- Multi-category assignments  

### Steps performed:
- Normalize text (remove whitespace, newlines)
- Parse category strings into structured format
- Drop sparse/unnecessary columns
- Handle malformed JSON entries
- Convert dataset into tree-friendly JSON

Output:
```

data/processed/cleaned_arxiv_tree_input.json

```

---

## Tree Implementation
Each paper is inserted into the tree based on its categories.

### Example:
```

math.CO → Root → math → CO
cs.CG   → Root → cs → CG

```

Flat categories:
```

hep-ph → Root → hep-ph

````

### Node Structure:
- Category name  
- Child nodes  
- List of associated papers  

---

## Search Functionality

### Category Search
Retrieve papers by:
- Top-level category  
- Subcategory  

Example:
```python
tree.search("cs", "CL")
````

---

### Keyword Search

Filter papers by keywords in:

* Title
* Abstract

Example:

```python
keyword_search(papers, "transformer")
```

---

## Efficiency

* Tree lookup: near O(1) using dictionary access
* Traversal: O(k) where k is number of relevant papers
* Keyword filtering: O(n) within selected node

This reduces unnecessary scanning of the full dataset.
